# Values and References

let's discuss how variables are handle when:

- returned from a function. (by value or reference?) (copy or move)
- pass to a function. (by value or reference?) (copy or move):
  You must determine if im going to modify the original object, or if i just need to get some information from it,
  in this case, i can pass the object as a reference.
  


- assigning from a existing variable. (e.g. Class b {a}) (by value or reference?) (copy or move)
- on loops (range-based for loop).
